# [Week 3 - Optimization](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/3/)

## Module description

This module introduces a number of optimisation algorithms, such as:

- Local search;
- Hill climbing;
- Simulated annealing;
- Linear programming.

It also describes some techniques and algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems, including:

- AC-3;
- Backtracking search.

## Projects

The module includes one project assignment:

### [Project 3.0: Crossword](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/3/crossword/)

The goal of this project is to write an algorithm that generates crossword puzzles given a crossword template and a word database. This is essentially a constraint satisfaction problem consisting of the following constraints:

- words should fit perfectly in their chosen spot in the crossword;
- the letters of the words in the crossword should agree at overlaps;
- no word should be repeated twice in the crossword.
