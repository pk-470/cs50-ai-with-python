# [Week 4 - Learning](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/4/)

## Module description

This module gives an overview of various methods and models used in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, namely:

- Classification, including methods such as:
  - k-nearest-neighbors classification;
  - linear regression;
  - support vector machines;
- Regression;
- Reinforcement learning;
- Markov decision processes;
- Q-learning;
- k-means clustering.

It also introduces techniques for handling data and assessing the performance of a model, such as:

- Loss functions;
- Overfitting;
- Regularisation.

Finally, it includes a brief tutorial on how to implement the above using the Python library _scikit-learn_.

## Projects

The module includes two project assignments:

### [Project 4.0: Shopping](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/shopping/)

This project is essentially an implementation of nearest-neighbor classification with the goal to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase or not.

### [Project 4.1: Nim](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/nim/)

The goal of this project is to write an AI that teaches itself to play [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) through reinforcement learning. While there are Python libraries that can achieve this with little effort, this project builds the AI from scratch.
