# [Week 2 - Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/2/)

## Module description

This module introduces some elementary probability theory and describes a number of models that apply probability to make optimal decisions based on limited information. Models covered include:

- Bayesian networks;
- Inference by sampling;
- Markov models;
- Hidden Markov models.

## Projects

The module includes two project assignments:

### [Project 2.0: PageRank](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/2/pagerank/)

This project implements the [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm to rank webpages according to importance. In short, the importance of each page is calculated based on the number of links that lead to it. The importance is calculated both through a "random surfer" model (i.e. a scenario where a hypothetical surfer on the internet clicks links at random) as well as a Markov model.

### [Project 2.1: Heredity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/2/heredity/)

The goal of this project is to write an algorithm that calculates the likelihood that a person has a particular genetic trait given limited data on their family's genome and known heredity probabilities.
