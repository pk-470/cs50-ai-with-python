# [Week 5 - Neural Networks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/5/)

## Module description

This module introduces the basics of artificial neural networks. Topics covered include:

- Activation functions;
- Gradient descent;
- Multilayer neural networks;
- Backpropagation;
- Recurrent neural networks (brief overview).

Moreover, it describes techniques used for computer vision, including image convolution and convolutional neural networks. Finally, it includes a brief tutorial on the Python library _TensorFlow_.

## Projects

The module includes one project assignment:

### [Project 5.0: Traffic](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/5/traffic/)

The goal of this project is to write an AI that can identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph. The project essentially consists of experimentation with different TensorFlow methods in order to build a convolutional neural network that achieves as accurate results as possible. The data set used in this project is GTSRB, which can be downloaded from [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip).
