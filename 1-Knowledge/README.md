# [Week 1 - Knowledge](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/weeks/1/)

## Module description

This module introduces the basics of propositional logic and the ways it can be represented in programming so that an AI can apply it to draw new conclusions based on given assumptions. Topics covered include:

- Model checking;
- Inference rules and algorithms;
- Conversion to Conjunctive Normal Form.

## Projects

The module includes two project assignments:

### [Project 1.0: Knights](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/knights/)

The goal of this project is to write an algorithm that can solve three "Knights and Knaves" problems using inference.

### [Project 1.1: Minesweeper](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/)

The aim of this project is to write an AI which can logically deduce the safe moves in a minesweeper game whenever possible.
